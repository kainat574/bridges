    <div class="col-6"><h3 style="border-bottom:2px solid #ffc451 ;">Lucky Knot Bridge (China) </h3>  The Lucky Knot Bridge is a steel truss bridge that spans the Dragon King Harbor River in Changsha, China. This knot-shaped bridge is actually formed by three different bridges woven together into a single structure, hence the name. The 185-meter-long pedestrian bridge crosses the Dragon King Harbors River in the Chinese city of Changsha. It was designed by NEXT architects, an international architecture firm based in Amsterdam. To design the Lucky Knot, the architects took inspiration from the principle of the Mobius ring and from the traditional Chinese art of knotting. The bridge includes three footpaths that connect two parks. From the bridge, it is possible to enjoy a stunning view of the surrounding landscape, which includes the river, the Maxi Lake, the mountains and the huge city of Changsha. The bridge was completed in 2016. 
    <p>“We refer to it as a Mobius ring," says Michel Schreinemachers, a partner at Next Architects, the firm that designed the bridge. “It’s a never ending shape.” </p>

Designed by architect Wilkinson Eyre, the bridge features two 75-foot-tall triangular lifting leaves, both powered by hydraulic rams that can open the bridge up to 15 times a day to allow for the passage of boats through the channel. In its closed position, the bridge is completely flat, but when the two triangular spans are lifted, the leaves resemble the sails of yachts.  According to Amusing Planet, it takes two minutes for the bridge to fully open.
    Wilkinson Eyre designed a bridge configured as a simple bascule – a flat deck with two hydraulically operated lifting sections. Normally the joint between each section is transverse, but the designers skewed it across the deck to create two triangular leaves.
    <p>This landmark structure is the first bridge of its type to be built in the the world. Its unique triangular-shaped lifting leaves reflect Poole's proud maritime and industrial heritage. When the bridge is up, the two lifting leaves symbolize the sails of a yacht and offer different views from every position along the quayside, from a sailing symbol to the spire of a cathedral. In its lowered position, the bridge offers stunning views across the natural beauty of Holes Bay.</p>

        The Eshima Ohashi Bridge, also known as the "Roller Coaster Bridge", is an incredible bridge in Japan with a truly extraordinary slope. It is the largest concrete frame rigid bridge in the country and the world’s third largest. This mega two-lane structure rises above Lake Nakaumi and connects the city of Matsue in the prefecture of Shimane with the city of Sakaiminato in the prefecture of Tottori.
        <br><p>The bridge was built to allow the passage of large cargo ships towards the open sea. It reaches an impressive height of 44 meters and has a breathtaking slope of 6.1% on one side and 5.1% on the other. It is one of the most unique bridges in the world that, despite measuring a length of 1 mile and a width of 7 meters – known for its steep ascents and descents.	
            The bridge does clearly angle up, as it’s built to let ships pass underneath. It goes pretty high! But the truth is .There’s no crazy steep incline!
            </p><p>Prefecture slope is 3.44 degrees, and the Shimane Prefecture slope is 2.86 degrees. Nothing crazy!</p>

With a cost of nearly VND 1.5 trillion ($88m), it offers six lanes for traffic and first opened on March 29, 2013, to celebrate the 38th anniversary of Da Nang’s liberation.  As you might or might not know, the design of Dragon Bridge is associated with the history of new architectural art in Da Nang. It is acquired from a competition among famous architects to bring the most exclusive design for the bridge. Two architects from the US with the design of a flying dragon have won the competition.
    <p>As a symbol of the Ly Dynasty, the dragon is a meaningful creature in Vietnamese folklore. In the lore, the dragon is known for flying to the sea and bringing back good luck. Residents hope that with a dragon soaring high through their sky, luck will continue to shine on the bustling city. And with the onslaught of media and spectator acclaim that the bridge has brought in, it seems as if they won't be disappointed.</p></div>

At night the blue navigation lights that surround the structure light up. This landmark  of Graz was designed by New York City artist Vito Acconci on the occasion of Graz becoming the 2003 European Capital of Culture
    <p>Is it a bridge? An island? A floating platform? Many consider Murinsel (or Island in the Mur) in Graz, Austria to be all three. Designed by American architect Vito Acconci, the Murinsel is a steel-and-glass structure that links the two banks of the Mur River. But more than just a footbridge to get to the other side, the Murinsel also features an artificial island with curves and twisted shapes that form a half-opened seashell. The "shell" shelters a floating cafe, a children's playground. The Murinsel, which originally was intended as a temporary project, has become a popular landmark which attracts numerous tourists to </p></div>

They are common in the southern part of the Northeast Indian state of Meghalaya.
        India’s famous living bridges – the roots of trees coaxed and stretched into the form of a suspension bridge over a river – have been submitted to UNICCO’s tentative list for the coveted world heritage site status.
        <p>A living root bridge is a type of simple suspension bridge formed of living plant roots by tree shaping. They are common in the southern part of the Northeast Indian state of Meghalaya. They are handmade from the aerial roots of rubber fig trees</p>A form of tree shaping creates incredible natural, suspension bridges in Meghalaya, India, the rainiest place on Earth. The tree roots are trained by the local Khasi people to grow through betel tree trunks which are placed across the gap, until the figs' roots take root on the other side. This process can take well over a decade before the bridge is fully functional and then over time the bridge grows and strengthens, according to In habitat.

The bridge is on top of Jamsu Bridge, forming the upper half of a double-deck bridge; it is the first double deck bridge built in South Korea. During periods of high rainfall, the Jamsu Bridge is designed to submerge as the water level of the river rises, as the lower deck lies close to the waterline. The bridge was built as a girder bridge and was completed in 1982.
    <p>The Banpo Bridge in Seoul, South Korea may be the most multifunctional bridge in the world. The span, which crosses over the Hangang River, is actually a two-tiered bridge. Banpo Bridge stands on top of the Jamsugyo (Submergence Bridge), which was designed to be submerged in water during the rainy season and accommodates two lanes for cars, a pedestrian walkway and a bicycle lane, according to Visit Korea, the official tourism website. In 2009, the Moonlight Rainbow Fountain was added to Banpo Bridge, making it the world's longest fountain bridge and the site of a spectacular water and light show, with 380 water jets, which shoot 190 tons of recycled river water per minute.

    <div class="col-7" style="border-right:2px solid #ffc451 ;"><h3 style="border-bottom:2px solid #ffc451 ;">Moses Bridge (Netherlands)</h3>In the 17th century, fortresses and moats protected the West Brabant Water Line region of the Netherlands against French and Spanish invaders. One of the forts, Fort de Roovere, has since fallen into disrepair but its restoration has given designers an opportunity to build an innovative bridge that can bring visitors across the moat. To preserve the "hidden" qualities of the fort, the designers built an "invisible" bridge across the moat, and constructed it so it can't be seen from a distance because the ground and the water come all the way up to its edge. The sunken bridge, called Moses Bridge, was named so because it invokes the biblical image of Moses parting the Red Sea, and gives the illusion of people crossing through the moat, according to the Daily Mail. 
    <p>f you have always dreamed of walking on water, the Moses Bridge is a safe way to make your dream a reality. Walking across the waters of an ancient moat which once repelled hostile invaders gives the Moses Bridge some added mystique. You can channel one of the most celebrated passages of the Old Testament, and consider a volatile moment in European history at the same time. A feat of modern engineering makes an ancient moat passable without visually interrupting the landscape. The Moses Bridge is cutting edge, functional, and mystical. It is no surprise that a progressive country like the Netherlands—which is known for its vibrant culture and creative take on urban living—would build such a practical and captivating bridge.</p></div>

 Henderson Waves, a structure not to be missed, connects Mount Faber Park to Telok Blangah Hill Park. Standing 36 metres above Henderson Road, it is the highest pedestrian bridge in Singapore, and is frequently visited for its artistic, distinctive wave-like structure consisting of a series of undulating curved 'ribs'
<p>Other highlights of the Southern Ridges include the Forest Walk and Canopy Walk – bridges cutting through the Adinandra Belukar, a distinct type of secondary forest. Here, you can see a rich variety of flora and fauna and observe birds in their natural habitat. Walk on the Ridges and capture the beauty of wild flowers and birds
 
    The structure's artistic merit is also not lost on its admirers. The undulating curved "ribs" actually double as alcoves that provide shelter to the public, says Singapore's National Parks Board. And at night, the bridge takes on a different look. The "waves" are illuminated with LED lights from 7 p.m. to 2 a.m. daily.

The innovative titling pedestrian and cyclist bridge, the Gateshead Millennium Bridge, has become a landmark for the northeast of England (it has even been featured in a postage stamp). The bridge is essentially two graceful curves, one forming the deck and the other supporting it, spanning between two islands running parallel to the quaysides, according to website of WilkinsonEyre Architects, the designers of the bridge. The curves then pivot around their common springing points to allow ships to pass beneath, using an innovative rotational movement similar to that of a slowly opening eyelid.
