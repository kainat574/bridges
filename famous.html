   <p>The Golden Gate Bridge is not the largest bridge in the world, nor the most significant from the architectural point of view of rhenium, and even more so its historical significance is doubtful, but without a doubt, the Golden Gate Bridge is the most famous and most photographed bridge in the world. The Golden Gate is a suspension bridge spanning the Golden Gate, the strait between San Francisco and Marin County to the north. Thanks to architect Joseph B. Strauss, whose statue adorns the southern observation deck, it took just seven years to build and was completed in 1937.</p>
   <p>The Golden Gate Bridge was the longest suspension bridge in the world at the time and is a major tourist attraction in San Francisco and California. Since its completion, span length has been surpassed by eight other bridges. The famous red-orange color of the bridge was specially chosen to make the bridge more visible in the dense fog that often envelops the bridge.

    <p>Ponte Vecchio, (Italian: “Old Bridge”) the first segmental arch bridge built in the West, which crosses over the Arno River at Florence and is an outstanding engineering achievement of Europe's Middle Ages. Its builder, Taddeo Gaddi, completed the bridge in 1345.</p>
    <p>The Ponte Vecchio is a Medieval bridge over the Arno River in Florence; the only Florentine bridge to survive WW2. The bridge is famous for still having shops built along it, as was common in the days of the Medici. Butchers initially occupied the shops; the present tenants are jewelers, art dealers and souvenir sellers. It is said that the economic concept of bankruptcy originated here: when a merchant could not pay his debts, the table on which he sold his wares (the “banco”) was physically broken (“rotto”) by soldiers, and this practice was called “bancorotto” (broken table).</p>

      <p>Tower Bridge is a combined bascule and suspension bridge in London, over the River Thames. It is close to the Tower of London, which gives it its name and has become an iconic symbol of London. Construction started in 1886 and It took eight years, five large contractors and the tireless work of 1,000 construction workers every day to build Tower Bridge, now one of the symbols of London. Two massive jetties were sunk into the riverbed to support construction, and over 11,000 tons of steel provided the base for the Tower and Promenade. This frame was clad in Cornish granite and Portland stone to protect the underlying steel and give the Bridge a more noble appearance.  The bridge consists of two towers which are tied together at the upper level by means of two horizontal walkways which are designed to withstand the forces of the suspended sections of the bridge.</p>

      <p>Completed in 1883, the Brooklyn Bridge connects Manhattan and Brooklyn and crosses the East River. At the time it was discovered, and for several years, it was the longest suspension bridge in the world. The Brooklyn Bridge is an iconic landmark and one of the symbols of New York. In 1964, the bridge was listed as a National Historic Site of the United States. </p>
      <p>The bridge has a wide footpath open to pedestrians and cyclists. This trail takes on a special significance during difficult times when conventional means of crossing the East River became unavailable, as happened during several power outages and most notably after the September 11, 2001 attacks</p>
      <p>The Brooklyn Bridge is a hybrid cable-stayed/suspension bridge in New York City, spanning the East River between the boroughs of Manhattan and Brooklyn. Opened on May 24, 1883, the Brooklyn Bridge was the first fixed crossing of the East River. It was also the longest suspension bridge in the world at the time of its opening, with a main span of 1,595.5 feet (486.3 m) and a deck 127 ft (38.7 m) above mean high water. The span was originally called the New York and Brooklyn Bridge or the East River Bridge but was officially renamed the Brooklyn Bridge in 1915.</p>

     <p>In 1357, Charles IV commissioned Peter Parler (architect of St. Vitus Cathedral) to replace the 12th-century Judith-Khevti Bridge, which had been washed away by floods in 1342. The new bridge was completed in 1390 and named Charles Bridge. 
      Charles Bridge is decorated with 30 statues on the parapets on both sides. Most of them were stationed there between 1706 and 1714. The first cross was erected on the Charles Bridge in the 14th century. The statue of Brunsquick was erected there until 1503, but only the pedestal has survived. It can be seen in the National Museum, and there is a replica on the Charles Bridge. The oldest surviving statue is St. John of Nepomuk from 1683, the newest is St. Cyril and Methodius from 1928. Several statues have been damaged by floods over the centuries. Mostly they were placed elsewhere, with replicas installed on the bridge.
      </p>
      <p>Charles Bridge is the most famous stone Gothic bridge in the world and crosses the Vltava River in Prague, Czech Republic. Today it is one of the most visited attractions in Prague with artists, street musicians and other actors performing on this bridge.</p>

     <p>The Yongji Bridge (also known as the Wind and Rain Bridge) was built in 1916 and is located in Chengyang, Sanjiang Autonomous Prefecture of Dong people near Liuzhou, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region of China. It is best known among the bridges in the Dong minority region in China. The bridge stretches across the Linxi River and is built of wood and stone without nails or rivets and is the largest of all wind and rain bridges in the world. 
    </p><p>Yongji Bridge has two platforms (one at each end of the bridge), 3 berths, 3 bays, 5 pavilions, 19 verandas and three floors. The berths are made of stone, the upper structures are mostly wooden and the roof is tiled. The bridge has wooden handrails on both sides. The Yongji Bridge has a total length of 64.4 meters and its corridor is 3.4 meters wide. The net height above the river is about 10 meters. The Yongji Bridge is located in Chengyang and serves as a link between two densely populated villages.</p>

      The Chapel Bridge is a 204 meter (670 ft) long bridge that crosses the Reis River in Lucerne, Switzerland. It is the oldest wooden bridge in Europe and one of the main tourist attractions in Switzerland. The covered bridge was built in 1333 and its main purpose was to protect Lucerne from attacks. A series of 17th century paintings depicting events from the history of Lucerne is now on display inside the bridge. Most of the bridge and most of these paintings were destroyed in 1993 by fire, but it was quickly rebuilt.
    </p>
    <p>The Kapellbrücke (literally, Chapel Bridge) is a covered wooden footbridge spanning the river Reuss diagonally in the city of Lucerne in central Switzerland. Named after the nearby St. Peter's Chapel the bridge is unique in containing a number of interior paintings dating back to the 17th century, although many of them were destroyed along with a larger part of the centuries-old bridge in a 1993 fire. Subsequently restored, the Kapellbrücke is the oldest wooden covered bridge in Europe, as well as the world's oldest surviving truss bridge. It serves as the city's symbol and as one of Switzerland's main tourist attractions.</p>

      <p>Crossing the Tagus River near the Spanish city of Alcantara, the Alcantara Bridge is a masterpiece of ancient Roman architecture. The bridge was built between 104 and 106AD by order of the Roman emperor Trajan, who was awarded a triumphal arch in the center of the bridge and a small temple at one end. The Alcantara Bridge had an extremely favorable strategic position and, as a result, it was often tried to be destroyed. The Moors destroyed the smallest arch on one side in 1543, while the second arch on the other side was damaged by the Spanish in the 18th century to stop the Portuguese. But despite this, the bridge has been perfectly preserved to this day.</p>
      <p>The Alcántara Bridge has suffered more damage from war than from the elements over the years. The Moors destroyed one of the smallest arches in 1214 although this was rebuilt centuries later, in 1543, with stone taken from the original quarries. The second arch on the northwest side was then later destroyed in 1760 by the Spanish to stop the Portuguese advancing and was repaired in 1762 by Charles III, only to be blown up again in 1809 by Wellington's forces attempting to stop the French. Temporary repairs were made in 1819, but much of the bridge was destroyed yet again in 1836 by the Carlists. The bridge was rebuilt in 1860 using mortared masonry.And following completion of the José María de Oriol Dam, which allowed for the draining of the Tagus riverbed, the main pillars were completely repaired in 1969.     
          The bridge originally measured 190 m (620 ft) in length, which today is reduced to 181.7 m (596 ft). The clear spans of the six arches from the right to the left riverside are 13.6 m (45 ft), 23.4 m (77 ft), 28.8 m (94 ft), 27.4 m (90 ft), 21.9 m (72 ft) and 13.8 m (45 ft).</p>

      <p >The Harbor Bridge or Sydney Bridge, also affectionately referred to by the locals as the "Clothes hanger" because of its distinctive shape, was opened on March 19, 1932 by Australian Prime Minister Jack Lang, after six years of construction. The bridge contains 6 million hand rivets. The surface area is equal to the area of 60 sports fields. The bridge has huge hinges to absorb the expansion caused by the hot Sydney sun. Sydney Bridge has one characteristic difference from most other bridges, it can be climbed by climbing with an excursion to the Southeast Pylon, from where there is a beautiful panoramic view of Sydney, and the opportunities for photographers are simply fantastic.
      </p><p>The Harbor Bridge is one of Australia's most famous and photographed landmarks. It is the world's largest (but not the longest) steel arch bridge with the top of the bridge 134 meters above Sydney Harbor.

      <p>Millau Bridge located on the uneven grounds of southern France represents one of the crowning achievements of European bridge building. Its impressive characteristics, such as the total distance of almost 2.5 kilometers,343 meters elevation from the ground, and the inclusion of eight large spans, made this bridge instantly took the breath away when it was constructed in 2004. Designed by Michel Virlogue and Norman Foster, the Millau Viaduct was built in about 3 years at a cost of 394 million euros.
        The Millau Viaduct is known as the tallest bridge in the world. He is also known for his design, which was considered impossible before his creation, as well as one of the greatest achievements in engineering and architecture.
        </p>
        <p>The Millau Viaduct (French: Viaduc de Millau, IPA: [vja.dyk də mi.jo]) is a multispan cable-stayed bridge completed in 2004 across the gorge valley of the Tarn near (west of) Millau in the Aveyron department in the Occitanie Region, in Southern France. The design team was led by engineer Michel Virlogeux and English architect Norman Foster. As of September 2020, it is the tallest bridge in the world, having a structural height of 336.4 metres (1,104 ft).</p>
