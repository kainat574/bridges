    <div class="col-6"><h3 style="border-bottom:2px solid #ffc451 ;">Viaduct Millau (France) </h3> <p>Millau Bridge located on the uneven grounds of southern France represents one of the crowning achievements of European bridge building. Its impressive characteristics, such as the total distance of almost 2.5 kilometers,343 meters elevation from the ground, and the inclusion of eight large spans, made this bridge instantly took the breath away when it was constructed in 2004. Designed by Michel Virlogue and Norman Foster, the Millau Viaduct was built in about 3 years at a cost of 394 million euros.
      The Millau Viaduct is known as the tallest bridge in the world. He is also known for his design, which was considered impossible before his creation, as well as one of the greatest achievements in engineering and architecture.</p>
      <p class="mt-3">The Millau Viaduct (French: Viaduc de Millau, IPA: [vja.dyk də mi.jo]) is a multispan cable-stayed bridge completed in 2004 across the gorge valley of the Tarn near (west of) Millau in the Aveyron department in the Occitanie Region, in Southern France. The design team was led by engineer Michel Virlogeux and English architect Norman Foster. As of September 2020, it is the tallest bridge in the world, having a structural height of 336.4 metres (1,104 ft).</p>

   <div class="col-7" style="border-right:2px solid #ffc451 ;"><h3 style="border-bottom:2px solid #ffc451 ;">Çanakkale Bridge</h3> <p>The 1915 Çanakkale Bridge has reached completion in Turkey with a span of 2,023 meters, becoming the longest suspension bridge in the world. Open to traffic over the Dardanelles waterway, the massive structure was created by consulting group COWI for contractor DLSY to connect Turkey's European and Asian shores. The bridge, named after the year of an important Ottoman naval victory against the British and the French during world war one, takes the title of the world's longest suspension bridge from the Akashi Kaikyo Bridge in Japan, which has a 1,992-metre-long span. The distinctive 318-metre-high red towers from which the 1915 Çanakkale Bridge's steel deck is suspended are also the tallest of any suspension bridge in the world, according to COWI.
    The 1915 Çanakkale Bridge has been a fantastic project to work with," concluded COWI's project director Inger Birgitte Kroon.
    </p>
    <p>"Not just for all the technical challenges that we as engineers love but also for the strong collaboration with DLSY, the owner and other involved parties," she continued. "Only with a collaborative mindset from all parties has it been possible to design and construct a world record suspension bridge in less than five years.</p>

      <p>The Pingtang Bridge is a bridge in Pingtang, Guizhou, China and carries the Pingtang Luodian Expressway over the deep Caodu River valley. With a height of 332 meters (1,089 ft), it is the third-tallest bridge in the world. It was opened to traffic on 30 December 2019. The bridge is a multi-span cable-stayed bridge with a length of 7,000 ft (2,100 m). With a main tower that has a height of 332 meters (1,089 ft), the bridge is the third tallest in the world. The tallest tower is 15 meters (49 ft) shorter than France's Millau Viaduct, which has a similar structure to the Pingtang Bridge. The bridge is also among the 20 highest in the world with a road deck 310 meters (1,020 ft) above the river below. The bridge cost 1.5 billion yuan (about 215 million U.S. dollars) to build.

      <p>The Hutong Yangtze River Bridge is a combined rail and road bridge which crosses the Yangtze River in Jiangsu, China. It is the easternmost railway crossing of the Yangtze river.
        On its upper level, it carries a six-lane highway. On its lower level it carries four railway tracks with a design speed of 200 km/h. The main cable-stayed span is 1,092 meters (3,583 ft) long and is supported by two 330 meters (1,080 ft) tall towers.The secondary arch span is 336 meters (1,102 ft) long.
        Construction began on 1 March 2014. The Nantong–Shanghai railway, opened on 1 July 2020, uses this bridge. 
    </p>
    <p>The Shanghai-Sutong Yangtze River Highway and Railway Bridge consists of 5 parts, which are the main channel bridge, the Tianshenggang channel bridge, the Henggangsha water area bridge, the bridge across the Yangtze river levee and the approach bridge on both sides.
        The structure of the bridge is a cable-stayed bridge with steel truss girder with twin towers and three cable faces.</p>

      <p>The ₺4.5 billion TRY Yavuz Sultan Selim Bridge caused quite a bit of controversy when it opened in 2016. The bridge is named after Selim I, who was the 9th Ottoman Emperor. Members of the Alevi religious minority protested when the bridge opened because they blame Selim I and his forces for persecuting and slaughtering their people. The suspension bridge stretches across the Bosphorus Strait and connects Europe to Asia. The bridge was designed to handle heavy traffic and has eight lanes for vehicles and two rail lines. Because the bridge is the first in the world to use a hybrid cable system, which is a combination of a cable-stayed bridge and suspension bridge, it is considered an impressive engineering feat.</p>
      The Yavuz Sultan Selim Bridge (Turkish: Yavuz Sultan Selim Köprüsü) is a bridge for rail and motor vehicle transit over the Bosphorus strait, to the north of two existing suspension bridges in Istanbul, Turkey. It was initially named the Third Bosphorus Bridge (with 15 July Martyrs Bridge being the First Bosphorus Bridge and Fatih Sultan Mehmet Bridge the Second Bosphorus Bridge). The bridge is located near the Black Sea entrance of the Bosphorus strait, between Garipçe in Sarıyer on the European side and Poyrazköy in Beykoz on the Asian side

<p>The Russky bridge stands 1,053 feet tall and was built to promote the 2012 Asia-Pacific Economic Community Project. The bridge is considered to be somewhat of a vanity project. The bridge, which cost $1.1 billion USD to build, is not only one of the tallest bridges in the world but also one of the longest. It’s the longest cable-stayed bridge in the world with a length of 3,622 feet (1,104 m).</p>
<p>The bridge has colloquially been called the bridge to nowhere because it connects Vladivostok, Russia to the sparsely populated Russky Island. Only about 5,000 people live on Russky Island, so the bridge is barely used. It was completed in July 2012 and opened by Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, and on September 3, 2012, the bridge was officially given its name. </p>

      <p>The Chishi Bridge is a bridge carrying the G76 Xiamen–Chengdu Expressway over a deep valley. At 380 meters (1,250 ft) the longest span is 38 meters (125 ft) longer than France's Millau Viaduct, which has a similar structure, but is longer and higher than the Chishi Bridge.It opened to use in 2016. 
        On June 10, 2017, The New York Times offered the Chishi Bridge as an example of one of China's many troubled bridge projects. They reported that the bridge's construction was significantly delayed, and went fifty percent over budget. The total cost of the project was US$300 million.

      <p>Opened in 1998, the bridge has a height of around 928 ft. Designed by Satoshi Kashima, the bridge has the longest suspension span in the entire world. This is also alternatively known as Pearl Bridge and Akashi Strait Bridge. Consisted of 3 spans, this happens to be standing on an earthquake-prone area, so engineers have featured various technological things to make it stay strong and endure natural calamities.
    </p>
    <p>The Akashi Kaikyō Bridge, also known as the Pearl Bridge, links the city of Kobe on the mainland of Honshu to Iwaya on Awaji Island, in Japan. It crosses the busy Akashi Strait. It carries part of the Honshu-Shikoku Highway. Since its completion, in 1998, the bridge has the longest central span of any suspension bridge in the world, at 1,991 metres. It is one of the key links of the Honshū-Shikoku Bridge Project, which created three routes across the Inland Sea.</p>
